I will attend the weekly class sessions to assist the professor and help students. I will also help host in-class programming competitions and mock interviews. Outside of class, I will grade student assignments, report feedback to the professor, and be available to answer students' questions.

                            <p>I am currently working on this project with a Computer Science research team under Dr. Sarah Cooney. It began as a project through Villanova's Undergraduate Research Fellowship (VURF) during the summer and has continued into the school year as I was hired as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. 
                                It focuses on the #antihaul trend on YouTube, expanding on my previous research on #sheinhaul and #thrifthaul. It is categorized as SHCI, a field exploring Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. I created Python programs utilizing YouTube's Public Data API to create a subset of videos that may be related to #antihaul.
                                Due to the unreliable nature of the API, I then manually reviewed each video to ensure it was properly related to #antihaul and belonged in our dataset. The team each watched these videos and noted video creator motivations informed by previous research. We searched for correlations between creator motivation and viewer engagement, but we found minimal correlation. 
                                I created a poster describing this research and presented with my team at Villanova's Undergraduate Research Symposium in November 2024. We have since continued this research, expanding into transcript analysis and vocabulary correlations, as well as utilizing sock puppets to analyze YouTube's recommendation algorithm relating to #antihaul.

                                        It focused on the #haul trend on YouTube, specifically examining #sheinhaul and #thrifthaul. It is categorized as SHCI, a field exploring Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. I created Python programs utilizing YouTube's Public Data API to create two subsets of videos. One subset was meant to be related to #sheinhaul, and the other related to #thrifthaul.
                                        Due to the unreliable nature of the API, the team then manually reviewed each video to ensure it was properly related to its related hashtag and belonged in our dataset. The team each watched these videos and noted elements of pro-consumption or anti-consumption. We found these themes in the videos themselves, in the video's description, or from the comments. 
                                        We analyzed this data with a focus on sustainability on VSPs (video sharing platforms). My team worked to create a full research paper which was submitted and accepted to NordiCHI 2024. It is published at the link above.

                                    <p>I worked on this project with a Mathematics research team under Dr. Alexander Diaz-Lopez. It applied through Villanova's Co-Master Program and was chosen by Dr. Diaz-Lopez to join the team.
                                        We explored the Tower of Hanoi and its known, most efficient solution. We aimed to find an equation which could determine the peg that any given disk was on at any given move. 
                                        As the only Computer Scientist on the team, I took on the role of creating simulations of the game to verify our equation on millions of inputs. I created these programs using Python and shared them with the team.
                                        We then proceeded to verify our solution through mathemtical proofs. Our team created a slideshow and presented at the EPaDel conference at Albright College and Villanova's Mathematics Symposium. 
                                        In addition, I created an informal website where users could input any move number and see the location of every disk in a 50-disk Tower of Hanoi. ss is available at the above link.

                            <p>I was unable to join the Programming Team formally in my freshman year due to my course schedule, but I used the same website, <i>Kattis</i>, to practice that the official team did. I am now ranked 1st individually out of all the Villanova accounts, most of whom have been on the website for years longer than me. 
                                Kattis and similar programming challenges have become some of my favorite pastimes. I was able to officially join the team at the beginning of my sophomore year and have since been named Vice President. 
                                I competed in my first coding competition with this team in November 2024. Our team traveled to Wilkes University to compete at the ICPC Competition in Division 2 for the Mid-Atlantic region. My teammate and I worked on programming problems in Python for five hours. 
                                We each solved a few problems individually before working together on the more difficult ones. When the competition concluded, my teammate and I had solved the most problems and placed 1st at the location. We later found we were 8th in the entire Mid-Atlantic region. 
                                My role on this team aided in my hiring as a TA for a Competitive Programming course in Spring 2025. Additionally, the team's faculty advisor has asked me to lead the weekly meetings this semester, catering to our members with varying levels of coding proficiency.

When I attended the ICPC competition in November 2024 with the Programming Team, I was the only woman alongside six men. This club has truly made me feel much more accepted in Computer Science and has encouraged me to stand my ground when I am often working with groups of men.</p>

                                It lasted for nearly two months over the summer with multiple meetings each week. These meetings were conducted virtually over Zoom and consisted of lectures and group projects with students nationwide. 
                                We programmed in Python and were able to send our code to one of IBM's quantum computers.

                         I have since been learning C++ to use in future programming competitions due to its efficiency. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and ReactNative in my Platform Based Computing course in Spring 2024. I learned C in my Computer Systems course in Fall 2024. 
                        I have used Git and various APIs for both personal and academic projects.</p>
